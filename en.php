                                   which has had alot of problems that apple fixed in the new model. iPhone 6 bent easily even
                                   in the users pocket which damaged the phone and it was unusable. Apple uses new metals
                                   that are also used in planes and made the phone thicker and more durable.",

"SW2" => "There is rivalry between iphone users and android users. They are saying android is
          more customizable but i dont want small thing that i will use only once. What i like
          about iOS is its intuitive usage, its simple and clean. The biggest advantage is
          security due to every aplication being locked up in ther own „sandbox“ unable to
          interact with other apps, control system or change files that dont belong to the
          aplication. Due to this its really hard to break into iOS.
